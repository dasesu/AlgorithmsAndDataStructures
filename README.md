# Algorithms, Data Structures and Codes
#### (A collection of programming algorithms, data structures and related codes)

Knowledge of Algorithmics is fundamental for software development.  In this repository  you will find a collection of my implementation of several of the fundamental programming algorithms, data structures, and common techniques used for problem solving.
